## Brief Introduction

Hello, everyone. Welcome to the repository of Ke Dai. <a href="http://stat545.com">Here is the link to the main STAT545 webpage. </a>

I am a MASc student in ECE. This is my second year in UBC. I am from China. Last year I really enjoyed the study and life here. I hope I will have much more fun and get to know lots of kind, smart and interesting guys this year. I am interesting in machine learning. As we know, R is becoming more and more popular as a programming language or tool for machine learning and data mining. Meanwhile, this semester I started to conduct my research in software engineering using NLP and data mining techniques. So that is why I take this course. 

In my spare time, I like playing table tennis, swimming, and travelling. By the way, I am a cat-holic. Look at this cat. It is so cute, isn't it? (https://media4.giphy.com/media/9uwnYUDw342pq/giphy.gif)
