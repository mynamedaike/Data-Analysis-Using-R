# Homework 01: Edit README.md and Use R Markdown

## Brief Self-Introduction

Hello, everyone. Welcome to the repository of Ke Dai. <a href="http://stat545.com">Here is the link to the main STAT545 webpage. </a>

I am a MASc student in ECE. This is my second year in UBC. I am from China. Last year I really enjoyed the study and life here. I hope I will have much more fun and get to know lots of kind, smart and interesting guys this year. I am interesting in **machine learning**. As we know, R is becoming more and more popular as a programming language or tool for **machine learning** and **data mining**. Meanwhile, this semester I started to conduct my research in software engineering using **NLP** and **data mining** techniques. So that is why I take this course. 

In my spare time, I like playing ***table tennis***, ***swimming***, and ***travelling***. By the way, I am a cat-holic. Look at this cat. It is so cute, isn't it?

## Report my process
- Step 1

I edited this README.md through the browser at github.com first. I added a brief self-introduction, a link to STAT545 webpage, and a picture of a lovely cat to it. And then I formatted this README file by refering to the sample readme file  and its raw source. For example, I made some words or phrases bold or italic and 
also highlighted the section headers. After editing the file, I entered the commit title and its description and clicked on the "commit changes" button to commit my update.

- Step 2

I started up the RStudio. From the user interface, I saw the local README.md was not updated. I clicked on the pull button in the top right window to update the local readme file. Just a second, the update was finished. Then I added report my process section to the README.md file using RStudio locally. Having edited the file, I saved this file locally by pressing shortcut keys command+s. Finally, I committed my changes by clicking on the Commit button and pushed the local documents to my github repository by clicking on the Push button.

- Step 3

After editting README.md file, I tried to extend the R markdown document. As I have no basics of R, I just followed the book ***R for Data Science***, copied some examples in it into the R markdown document and tried to figure out the syntax of every command. Compared to editing README.md, this part is much more difficult for me. I need to spend more time to learn basic syntax of R. ***R for Data Science*** is a really great tutorial for me to get started with writing R program.

- Problems

Initially, when I tried to create a project by version control, it does not work. And then I asked one of the TAS for this course. He helped me solve this problem. For the first clone, I have to execute it in the shell using the command ***git clone url***.
