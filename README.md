# Homework 01: Edit README.md and Use R Markdown

## Brief Self-Introduction

Hello, everyone. Welcome to the repository of Ke Dai. <a href="http://stat545.com">Here is the link to the main STAT545 webpage. </a>

I am a MASc student in ECE. This is my second year in UBC. I am from China. Last year I really enjoyed the study and life here. I hope I will have much more fun and get to know lots of kind, smart and interesting guys this year. I am interesting in **machine learning**. As we know, R is becoming more and more popular as a programming language or tool for **machine learning** and **data mining**. Meanwhile, this semester I started to conduct my research in software engineering using **NLP** and **data mining** techniques. So that is why I take this course. 

In my spare time, I like playing ***table tennis***, ***swimming***, and ***travelling***. By the way, I am a cat-holic. Look at this cat. It is so cute, isn't it?

## Report my process
- Step 1

I edited this README.md through the browser at github.com first. I added a brief self-introduction, a link to STAT545 webpage, and a picture of a lovely cat to it. And then I formatted this README file by refering to the sample readme file  and its raw source. For example, I made some words or phrases bold or italic and 
also highlighted the section headers. After editing the file, I entered the commit title and its description and clicked on the "commit changes" button to commit my update.
- Step 2

I started up the RStudio. From the user interface, I saw the local README.md was not updated. I clicked on the pull button in the top right window to update the local readme file. Just a second, the update was finished. Then I added report my process section to the README.md file using RStudio locally. Having edited the file, I saved this file locally by pressing shortcut keys command+s. Finally, I committed my changes by clicking on the Commit button and pushed the local documents to my github repository by clicking on the Push button.
